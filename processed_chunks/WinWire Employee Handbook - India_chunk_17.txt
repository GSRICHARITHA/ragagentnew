Ethics, as you are all aware, means doing the right thing, all the time, at any cost. Doing the right thing, no matter the consequence to us. Remembering there is no right way to do the wrong thing. More as a guideline, we have attempted here to capture some key points around business ethics at WinWire. At all times: o We produce bills only when the expenses have been incurred by us, and only to the extent of the actual expense. For example, if we incur an expense of Rs. 800/- while travelling from office to client place, and the policy allows the employee to claim up to Rs. 1000/- on actuals, we claim Rs. 800/-. o We produce original bills which we collect from the vendor. We should insist the vendors to provide us with bills that have complete information.. We should avoid accepting bills that carry incomplete information and refrain from making an attempt to complete it by ourselves. o In the records we furnish to the company, we provide correct & complete information about our previous employment, education and compensation. o We avoid accepting any gifts directly or indirectly
